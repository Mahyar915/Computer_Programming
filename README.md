//In this programming assignment you will be creating a limited simulation of roulette. Roulette is a game in which 
participants place wagers regarding the outcome of a ball landing in one of 38 numbered bins (0-36, plus an 
additional slot labelled 00) on a spinning wheel. You will simulate wagering, the ball landing on the spinning 
wheel, and the outcome of the wager; that is, whether the participant wins or loses the wager.
