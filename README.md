//Roulette Simulation Project
Overview
This project simulates a simple roulette game using C++ where players can place bets on various outcomes and simulate spins to determine wins and losses. Players begin with a starting chip balance and make wagers based on even/odd numbers, halves of the number set, or exact number guesses.

Features
Starting Balance: Players start with 1000 chips.
Wager Options: Players can wager on even or odd numbers, 1st or 2nd half of numbers, or an exact number guess.
Payouts: Wagers have corresponding payouts, with 1 to 1 for even/odd/half bets, and 35 to 1 for exact guesses.
Input Validation: The program validates user input for wager type and chip amount, ensuring valid wagers.
Simulation: A "spin" is simulated with a random number selection to represent the roulette wheel outcome.
Winning/Losing: Wagers are settled according to the outcome of the "spin" with appropriate chips awarded or deducted.
User Interaction: The user is prompted to confirm their wagers and has the option to continue or end the game after each spin.
Game End Summary: The program provides a summary of the playerâ€™s chip balance at the end of the game.
